# Ecole-42
A repo of all works and projects that are done in 42SG (currently pursuing)

## Circle 2
### Push_swap
> The goal of this project is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of stack operations, in as few moves as possible. This project helps to develop efficient algorithms and improve your understanding of data structures, sorting logic, and algorithmic optimization in C.

### Pipex
> This project is designed to recreate the behavior of the shell pipe (|) by executing multiple commands and connecting their inputs and outputs through file descriptors. It helps you understand how processes communicate, and how to use system calls like pipe(), fork(), and execve() to manage process creation and data flow in C.

### So_Long
> This project is designed to introduce you to basic 2D game development using the MiniLibX library. The goal is to create a small game where the player collects items and reaches an exit while navigating through a map. Through this project, you’ll learn about graphics rendering, event handling, and implementing a simple game loop in C.

## Circle 1
### ft_printf
> The goal of this project is to study and reimplement one of the most widely used and versatile functions in C — printf() — while gaining a deeper understanding of variadic functions and how they work in C.

### Get_Next_Line
> The goal of this project is to create a function that reads and returns one line at a time from a file descriptor. This project helps you practice file I/O, static variables, and memory management in C while learning to handle buffers, end-of-file cases, and dynamic string construction.

## Circle 0
### Libft
> This project is designed to help us understand how common standard functions work by implementing them ourselves and learning to use them effectively. Ultimately, we will create our own library that we can use in future C projects, where permitted. This library will continue to grow and evolve throughout the course.
